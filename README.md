# Space Bird
Space Bird is an iOS game written in Swift and is intended for iOS versions 9.0 or above. The objective of the game is to help the bird fly as high as possible without falling off the bottom by tapping the screen. The user collects dragonflies to earn speed boosts, while attempting to avoiding bees. Collisions with bees slow the bird down, particularly when multiple bees are hit within a short time frame.
