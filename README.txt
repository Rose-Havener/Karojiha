"Space Bird" is a simple game that was designed and developed during Paul Cantrell's
Software Development course at Macalester College in Fall of 2017.

The game is written in Swift (using SpriteKit) and intended for use on iOS devices 
running iOS 9.0 or later.

The object of the game is to move a bird (by tapping) as high as possible without falling 
off the bottom of the screen. The user should collect dragonflies to earn speed boosts, and 
avoid colliding with bees - which will slow the user significantly if multiple are hit 
within a short time frame.

=====================================================================================

TO RUN THIS GAME ON YOUR DEVICES:
1: You are going to need a Mac running macOS Sierra 10.12.4 or later
2: Make sure you have XCode 9.0 (or newer versions) installed from the App Store
3: Navigate your target location in your terminal and run 
	git clone https://github.com/jinapark22/Karojiha
4: Open the project in XCode - you can play the game in one of the built in simulators.
      
If you want to run the app on a mobile device, plug an iPhone into your
computer with a USB cable and select your phone as the desired output target
from the dropdown menu located to the right of the "Stop" button
on the top left-hand corner of the screen.
