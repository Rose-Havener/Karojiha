"Space Bird" is a simple game that was designed and developed during Paul Cantrell's
Software Development course at Macalester College in Fall of 2017.

The game is written in Swift (using SpriteKit) and intended for use on iOS devices 
running iOS 9.0 or later.

The object of the game is to move a bird (by tapping) as high as possible without falling 
off the bottom of the screen. The user should collect dragonflies to earn speed boosts, and 
avoid colliding with bees - which will slow the user significantly if multiple are hit 
within a short time frame.

Enjoy!
